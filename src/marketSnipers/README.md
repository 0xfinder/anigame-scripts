# Overview of Market Snipers

## below69.py

Snipes any SR/UR card below specified cost

## marketSniper.py

Snipe any cards below a specified price, and allow custom prices for SR and UR cards

## below69regex.py

Same as below69 but using regex, I have not extensively tested their speeds but it seems like they're both the same
